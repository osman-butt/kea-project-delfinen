# kea-project-delfinen
This project is a mandatory assignment for the Computer Science Programme @ KEA. 

The project is based on a case, where a swimming club (Sv√∏mmeklubben Delfinen) needs a system to manage swimming results, subscription payments and members.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used for the frontend.

As a backend, Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and retrieve data, and Firebase Auth is used to handle login authentication.

## Users and access
There are 5 different predefined users. Only authenticated and authorized users are able to see the content. 

Communication with the database is done via an API endpoint, which only authenticated and authorized users can consume.
